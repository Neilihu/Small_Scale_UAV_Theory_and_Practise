Running Guidance:
1. cd into 'pathfollowing' directory
2. Run 'python FinalProject.py'
2. In the Path Input tab, modify parameters you want to use
    2.1 Select wether you want to observe the 'straight line' or 'circular path' following modes
    2.2a Set a proper OriginX, OriginY, OriginZ, and Course for straight line (we use course currently due to GUI reasons but may switch to endpoint)
    2.2b Set a proper OriginX, OriginY, OriginZ, R, and Direction for circular path
    2.3 Click Apply Mode
    2.4 Click Generate Path to show the desiered path
    2.5 if you want to change wind choose a wind kind and click Apply Winds
3. Click start to start simulation
4. While the simulator is running, it is avaliable to change the path
    4.1 following step 2.2 to modify the path parameters
        4.1.1 For each parameter, the modification direcly apply to the UAV but not the path
    4.2 click Generate Path to show the newest path
    4.3 You can also modify wind. Following the 2.5

Current progress:
Currently we are able to show the path in the simulator and running circular pathfollowing algorithm.We think we are on the right track.
One thing that surprised us is that we can modify the path during the simulating without bug.
